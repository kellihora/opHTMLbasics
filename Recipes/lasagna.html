        <li>0.75 lb. mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
        <li>0.75 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven 
            over medium heat until well browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, 
            tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 
            tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, 
            fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1.5 hours, 
            stirring occasionally.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook 
            lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain 
            noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine 
            ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 
            0.5 teaspoon salt.
        </li>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>
            To assemble, spread 0.5 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 
            9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat 
            sauce. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 
            1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1.5 cups meat sauce 
            over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. 
            Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan 
            cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil 
            with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and 
            bake for an additional 25 minutes. Rest lasagna for 15 minutes 
            before serving.
